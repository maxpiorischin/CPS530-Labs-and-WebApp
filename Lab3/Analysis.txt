After creating both versions of the responsive webpage, I believe the Bootstrap
version was easier and more efficient to implement with. Some challenges I
experienced for Non-Bootstrap was the long media queries I had to create to
fully customize the layout for all device types. On the contrary, the Bootstrap
implementation managed most of the responsive design for me. On the contrary, I
had more options for customizability compared to Bootstrap. An issue I faced
with Bootstrap was the figuring out the initial installation, and understanding
all the feautures and elements available for me to use. Once I figured these
features out, I was able to make my website look much more clean- and the
responsiveness transition smoothly without too much of my own addition. Overall,
Bootstrap took less time and was much more effective for me, I'll be using it
for my future projects.
