            <h3> Quick Summary of Me </h3>
            <p> I was born on December 25th, 2002 in Toronto, Ontario. My parents had both immigrated from Bulgaria,
                and taught me Russian as my first language. 
                I grew up playing hockey for most of my life, and staying physically active.

            padding-left: .5rem;
            margin-left: .5rem;
            float: right;
            font-style: italic;
            "> <p>Side-note: My entire life I would visit my family in Europe during the summer,<br> but I have not been able to the past 2 years due to Covid-19. </p>

            <p>
                My favourite thing to do has to be  
                travelling around the world. I love going on vacations in the Carribean, but also visiting historic sites and museums.
                My dream is to visit every country in Europe and experience the beauty of each country I visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I was approximately 15 years old, <br> I introduced myself to the world of coding, which to
                this day has been a passion of mine. I enjoy learning new technologies and progressing my skills, but also taking a break
                with video games and such. I'm looking forward to learning more about web development and advancing my career!
